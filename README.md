Fraud Detection Using Logistic Regression 🕵️‍♀️💳
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a supervised machine learning approach. Specifically, the Logistic Regression algorithm is implemented to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used is highly imbalanced, as fraudulent transactions represent a small fraction of the total. Preprocessing steps were applied to handle the class imbalance and prepare the data for training.

🔍 Methodology

1) Data Preprocessing:

🧹 Feature scaling and normalization were applied to ensure the model performs optimally.

⚖️ Handling class imbalance through techniques such as oversampling (SMOTE) or adjusting class weights in the logistic regression model.

2) Model Implementation:

🤖 Logistic Regression was chosen due to its interpretability and efficiency for binary classification tasks.
📚 The model was trained and validated on the dataset, with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score used for evaluation.

3)Evaluation:

📈 The model's performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix and various metrics, focusing on precision and recall due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset.

🏆 Results

The Logistic Regression model achieved significant results in identifying fraudulent transactions, with an emphasis on minimizing false negatives (frauds classified as non-fraudulent).

Metrics such as recall and F1-score highlight the model's effectiveness in this context.

📝 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of Logistic Regression in fraud detection scenarios, highlighting its simplicity and effectiveness. Future work could explore additional algorithms, ensemble methods, or more advanced preprocessing techniques to further enhance accuracy.
